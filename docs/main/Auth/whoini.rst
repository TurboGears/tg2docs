Using who.ini
=============

Once you have disabled your quickstart configuration
(see :ref:`disabling-auth`), you may find yourself wanting to
use the `who.ini` configuration mechanism referenced in
most `repoze.who` documentation.  This section describes how
to create a `who.ini`-based configuration that looks much
like the quickstart configuration you just disabled.

Since `repoze.who` is WSGI middleware, you will need to alter
your project's `project.config.middleware.py` file to create
your middleware from your .ini file:

.. code-block:: python

    from repoze.who.config import make_middleware_with_config as make_who_with_config
    ...
        # Wrap your base TurboGears 2 application with custom middleware here
        app = make_who_with_config(
            app,
            global_conf,
            app_conf.get('who.config_file','who.ini'),
            app_conf.get('who.log_file','stdout'),
            app_conf.get('who.log_level','debug')
        )

and add the following to your config file's app:main section:

.. code-block:: ini

    who.config_file = %(here)s/who.ini
    who.log_level = debug
    who.log_file = stdout

at this point, you are using the standard `repoze.who` configuration mechanism,
so should be able to follow most `repoze.who` documentation to complete your
configurations.

Quickstart via `who.ini`
------------------------

If you would like to start off your customizations with something similar
to the `repoze.who.quickstart` mechanism, you can use standard mechanisms
to set up most of the machinery that the quickstart provides.  Here is a
sample `who.ini` that provides much of the quickstart behaviour:

.. code-block:: ini

    # Sample of a who.ini file from which to begin configuring
    # this looks a lot like the "quickstart" application's setup,
    # minus the translation capability...

    [plugin:auth_tkt]
    # Cookie-based session identification storage
    use = repoze.who.plugins.auth_tkt:make_plugin
    secret = 'this secret is not really very SECRET!'

    [plugin:friendlyform]
    # Redirecting form which does login via a "post"
    # from a regular /login form
    use = repoze.who.plugins.friendlyform:FriendlyFormPlugin
    login_form_url= /login
    login_handler_path = /login_handler
    logout_handler_path = /logout_handler
    rememberer_name = auth_tkt
    post_login_url =
    post_logout_url =

    [plugin:sqlauth]
    # An SQLAlchemy authorization plugin
    use = customwho.lib.auth:auth_plugin

    # Now the configuration starts wiring together the pieces
    [general]
    request_classifier = repoze.who.classifiers:default_request_classifier
    challenge_decider = repoze.who.classifiers:default_challenge_decider

    [identifiers]
    # We can decide who the user is trying to identify as using either
    # a fresh form-post, or the session identifier cookie
    plugins =
        friendlyform;browser
        auth_tkt

    [authenticators]
    plugins =
        sqlauth

    [challengers]
    plugins =
        friendlyform;browser

    [mdproviders]
    # Metadata providers are the things that actually look up a user's credentials
    # here we have a plugin that provides "user" information (md_plugin) and another,
    # which acts as an adapter to the first, to provide group/permission information.
    plugins =
        customwho.lib.auth:md_plugin
        customwho.lib.auth:md_group_plugin

Note that "customwho" is the project name here.  Also note that the `who.ini`
file references a custom Python module `customwho.lib.auth` which is where
we set up our `repoze.who` plugins in the normal manner for `repoze.who`:

.. code-block:: python

    """Example of a simplistic, importable authenticator plugin

    Intended to work like a quick-started SQLAlchemy plugin"""
    from repoze.who.plugins.sa import (
        SQLAlchemyAuthenticatorPlugin,
        SQLAlchemyUserMDPlugin,
    )
    from repoze.what.plugins.sql import configure_sql_adapters
    from repoze.what.middleware import AuthorizationMetadata

    from customwho import model
    auth_plugin = SQLAlchemyAuthenticatorPlugin(model.User, model.DBSession)
    md_plugin = SQLAlchemyUserMDPlugin(model.User, model.DBSession )
    _source_adapters = configure_sql_adapters(
        model.User,
        model.Group,
        model.Permission,
        model.DBSession,
    )
    md_group_plugin = AuthorizationMetadata(
        {'sqlauth': _source_adapters['group']},
        {'sqlauth': _source_adapters['permission']},
    )

    # THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT!  Without this your site will
    # consider every repoze.what predicate True!
    from repoze.what.plugins.pylonshq import booleanize_predicates
    booleanize_predicates()

This module creates a number of plugins which the `who.ini` file references.
It is also possible to configure plugins to accept parameters from the
`who.ini` configuration file (by specifying a plugin: section and providing
the parameters).

..  warning::

    Without the `booleanize_predicates()` call you will find that almost all
    TurboGears code will fail.  TurboGears calls this when the authorization
    stack is enabled (we have disabled it, you will recall), and most TurboGears
    code was written to expect the authorization stack to be enabled.
