==================
Getting Started
==================

Most new users should follow the :ref:`downloadinstall` and then continue on
to :ref:`quickstarting`, after which they should look at the first
few basic moves in :ref:`basic_moves`.

When you feel confident with your understanding of TurboGears at high level
you should give a look at our TurboGears Book and its 20 Minutes Wiki Tutorial
to get start with your first real web application.

This is a set of more advanced tutorial that cover some common framework usages.
We suggest to give a look at the :ref:`explorequickstart` tutorial for a better
grasp of a tipical TurboGears web application structure.

Sometimes, you don't need a tutorial. Sometimes, you just need to see
some sample code, or get a specific answer to a specific question, and
tutorials are just too much for you. If that's you, might we suggest
checking out our :ref:`Recipes and FAQ <recipes-and-faq>`?

Old Tutorials
============================

Those tutorials are related to parts of the framework that
got deprecated in the past and are here only for reference
or for projects that still rely on previous versions of
TurboGears.
