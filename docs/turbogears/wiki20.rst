Full Stack TurboGears: Wiki in 20 Minutes
=========================================

How does TurboGears2 help you get development done quickly? We'll show
you by developing a simple wiki application that should take you no
more than 20 minutes to complete. We're going to do this without
explaining the steps in detail (that is what this book is for, after
all). As a result, you'll see how easily you can make your own web
applications once you are up to speed on what TurboGears2 offers.

If you're not familiar with the concept of a wiki you might want to
check out `the Wikipedia entry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki>`_.
Basically, a wiki is an easily-editable collaborative web content
system that makes it trivial to link to pages and create new pages.
Like other wiki systems, we are going to use CamelCase words to
designate links to pages.

If you have trouble with this tutorial ask for help on the `TurboGears
discussion list`_, or on the IRC channel #turbogears.  We're a
friendly bunch and, depending what time of day you post, you'll get
your answer in a few minutes to a few hours. If you search the mailing
list or the web in general you'll probably get your answer even
faster. **Please don't post your problem reports as comments on this
or any of the following pages of the tutorial**. Comments are for
suggestions for improvement of the docs, not for seeking support.

If you want to see the final version you can download a copy of the
`wiki code`_.

Installing the Development Tools
================================

The TurboGears2 Development Tools are a bunch of commands and extensions useful when
developing TurboGears2 applications. They provide the ``gearbox`` suite of commands
to create new full stack projects, quickly create controllers, templates, models and
the TurboGears debugbar.

.. parsed-literal::

    (tgenv)$ pip install |private_index_path| tg.devtools

Quickstart
==========

TurboGears2 provides a suite of tools for working with projects by
adding several commands to the Python command line tool ``gearbox``. A
few will be touched upon in this tutorial. (Check the
:ref:`GearBox <tg-gearbox>` section for a full listing.) The first tool
you'll need is ``quickstart``, which initializes a TurboGears project.
Go to a command line window and run the following command::

    (tgenv)$ gearbox quickstart wiki20

This will create a project called wiki20 with the default template engine and with authentication.
TurboGears2 projects usually share a common structure, which should look like::

     wiki20
     ├── __init__.py
     ├── config       <-- Where project setup and configuration relies
     ├── controllers  <-- All the project controllers, the logic of our web application
     ├── i18n         <-- Translation files for the languages supported
     ├── lib          <-- Utility python functions and classes
     ├── model        <-- Database models
     ├── public       <-- Static files like CSS, javascript and images
     ├── templates    <-- Templates exposed by our controllers.
     ├── tests        <-- Tests
     └── websetup     <-- Functions to execute at application setup. Like creating tables, a standard user and so on.

.. note::

    We recommend you use the names given here: this documentation looks
    for files in directories based on these names.

You need to update the dependencies in the file ``Wiki-20/setup.py``.
Look for a list named ``install_requires`` and append the ``docutils``
entry at the end. TurboGears2 does not require docutils,
but the wiki we are building does.

Your ``install_requires`` should end up looking like:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 13

    install_requires=[
        "TurboGears2 >= 2.3.9",
        "Babel",
        "Beaker",
        "Kajiki",
        "zope.sqlalchemy >= 0.4",
        "sqlalchemy",
        "alembic",
        "repoze.who",
        "tw2.forms",
        "tgext.admin >= 0.6.1",
        "WebHelpers2",
        "docutils"
    ]

Now to be able to run the project you will need to install it and
its dependencies. This can be quickly achieved by running from
inside the ``wiki20`` directory::

    $ pip install -e .

.. note::
    If you skip the ``pip install -e .`` command you might end up with an error that looks
    like: *pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: tw2.forms: Not Found for: wiki20 (did you run python setup.py develop?)*
    This is because some of the dependencies your project depend on the options you choose while
    quickstarting it.

You should now be able to start the newly create project with the ``gearbox serve`` command::

    (tgenv)$ gearbox serve --reload --debug
    Starting subprocess with file monitor
    Starting server in PID 32797.
    serving on http://127.0.0.1:8080

.. note::
    The ``--reload`` option makes the server restart whenever a file is changed, this greatly speeds
    up the development process by avoiding to manually restart the server whenever we need to try
    our changes.

.. note::
    The ``--debug`` option provides full stacktrace in case the server was unable to start, this
    is useful in case your server didn't start due to a configuration error.

Pointing your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ should open up the TurboGears2 welcome page.
By default newly quickstarted projects provide a bunch of pages to guide the user through
some of the foundations of TurboGears2 web applications.

Controller And View
===================

TurboGears follows the `Model-View-Controller paradigm`_
(a.k.a. "MVC"), as do most modern web frameworks like Rails, Django,
Struts, etc.

Taking a look at the http://127.0.0.1:8080/about page is greatly suggested
to get an overview of your newly quickstarted project and how TurboGears2
works.

If you take a look at the code that ``quickstart`` created, you'll see
everything necessary to get up and running. Here, we'll look at the
two files directly involved in displaying this welcome page.

Controller Code
---------------

.. highlight:: python

``Wiki-20/wiki20/controllers/root.py`` (see below) is the code that
causes the welcome page to be produced. After the imports the first
line of code creates our main controller class by inheriting from
TurboGears' ``BaseController``::

    class RootController(BaseController):

The TurboGears 2 controller is a simple object publishing system; you
write controller methods and ``@expose()`` them to the web. In our
case, there's a single controller method called ``index``. As you
might guess, this name is not accidental; this becomes the default
page you'll get if you go to this URL without specifying a particular
destination, just like you'll end up at ``index.html`` on an ordinary
web server if you don't give a specific file name. You'll also go to
this page if you explicitly name it, with
``http://localhost:8080/index``. We'll see other controller methods
later in the tutorial so this naming system will become clear.

The ``@expose()`` decorator tells TurboGears which template to use to
render the page.  Our ``@expose()`` specifies::

    @expose('wiki20.templates.index')

This gives TurboGears the template to use, including the path
information (the ``.xhtml`` extension is implied). We'll look at this
file shortly.

Each controller method returns a dictionary, as you can see at the end
of the ``index`` method. TG takes the key:value pairs in this
dictionary and turns them into local variables that can be used in the
template.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 13-16

    from tg import expose, flash, require, url, request, redirect
    #Skipping some imports here...

    class RootController(BaseController):
        secc = SecureController()
        admin = AdminController(model, DBSession, config_type=TGAdminConfig)

        error = ErrorController()

        def _before(self, *args, **kw):
            tmpl_context.project_name = "Wiki 20"

        @expose('wiki20.templates.index')
        def index(self):
            """Handle the front-page."""
            return dict(page='index')

        #more controller methods from here on...

Displaying The Page
-------------------

`Wiki-20/wiki20/templates/index.xhtml` is the template
specified by the ``@expose()`` decorator, so it formats what you view
on the welcome screen. Look at the file; you'll see that it's standard
XHTML with some simple namespaced attributes. This makes it very
designer-friendly, and well-behaved design tools will respect all the
:ref:`kajiki-language` attributes and tags.  You can even open it directly in your
browser.

Kajiki directives are elements and/or attributes in the template that
are prefixed with ``py:``. They can affect how the template is
rendered in a number of ways: Kajiki provides directives for
conditionals and looping, among others.  We'll see some simple Kajiki
directives in the sections on :ref:`Editing pages <editing_pages>` and
:ref:`Adding views <adding_views>`.

    </html>



Wiki Model
=======================

``quickstart`` produced a directory for our model in
`Wiki-20/wiki20/model/`. This directory contains an `__init__.py`
file, which makes that directory name into a python module (so you can
use ``import model``).

Since a wiki is basically a linked collection of pages, we'll define a
``Page`` class as the name of our model.

Create a new file called ``Wiki-20/wiki20/model/page.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from sqlalchemy import *
    from sqlalchemy.orm import mapper, relation
    from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey, Column
    from sqlalchemy.types import Integer, Text

    from wiki20.model import DeclarativeBase, metadata, DBSession

    class Page(DeclarativeBase):
        __tablename__ = 'page'

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        pagename = Column(Text, unique=True)
        data = Column(Text)

Now to let TurboGears know that our model exists we must make it available inside the ``Wiki-20/wiki20/model/__init__.py``
file just by importing it at the end:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import your model modules here.
    from wiki20.model.auth import User, Group, Permission
    from wiki20.model.page import Page

.. warning::

    It's very important that this line is at the end because
    ``Page`` requires the rest of the model to be initialized
    before it can be imported:

Initializing The Tables
-----------------------

Now that our model is recognized by TurboGears we must create the table that it is going to use
to store its data. By default TurboGears will automatically create tables for each model it is aware of,
this is performed during the application setup phase.

The setup phase is managed by the ``Wiki-20/wiki20/websetup`` python module, we are just
going to add to``websetup/boostrap.py`` the lines required to create a FrontPage page for
our wiki, so it doesn't start empty.

We need to update the file to create our `FrontPage` data just before
the ``DBSession.flush()`` command by adding:

.. code-block:: python

    page = model.Page(pagename="FrontPage", data="initial data")
    model.DBSession.add(page)

You should end up having a ``try:except:`` block that should
look like:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 8-9

    def bootstrap(command, conf, vars):
        #Some comments and setup here...

        try:
            #Users and groups get created here...
            model.DBSession.add(u1)

            page = model.Page(pagename="FrontPage", data="initial data")
            model.DBSession.add(page)

            model.DBSession.flush()
            transaction.commit()
        except IntegrityError:
            #Some Error handling here...

The ``transaction.commit()`` call involves the transaction manager used
by TurboGears2 which helps us to support cross database transactions, as well as
transactions in non relational databases.

Now to actually create our table and our `FrontPage` we simply need to run
the ``gearbox setup-app`` command where your application configuration file is available
(usually the root of the project):

.. code-block:: bash

    (tgenv)$ gearbox setup-app
    Running setup_app() from wiki20.websetup
    Creating tables

A file named ``Wiki-20/devdata.db`` should be created which contains
your ``sqlite`` database.
For other database systems refer to the ``sqlalchemy.url``
line inside your configuration file.


Adding Controllers
==================

.. highlight:: python

Controllers are the code that figures out which page to display, what
data to grab from the model, how to process it, and finally hands off
that processed data to a template.

``quickstart`` has already created some basic controller code for us
at `Wiki-20/wiki20/controllers/root.py`.

First, we must import the ``Page`` class from our model. At the end of
the ``import`` block, add this line::

    from wiki20.model.page import Page

Now we will change the template used to present the data, by changing
the ``@expose('wiki20.templates.index')`` line to::

    @expose('wiki20.templates.page')

This requires us to create a new template named `page.xhtml` in the
`wiki20/templates` directory; we'll do this in the next section.

Now we must specify which page we want to see.  To do this, add a
parameter to the ``index()`` method. Change the line after the
``@expose`` decorator to::

    def index(self, pagename="FrontPage"):

This tells the ``index()`` method to accept a parameter called
``pagename``, with a default value of ``"FrontPage"``.

Now let's get that page from our data model.  Put this line in the
body of ``index``::

    page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()

This line asks the SQLAlchemy database session object to run a query
for records with a ``pagename`` column equal to the value of the
``pagename`` parameter passed to our controller method.  The
``.one()`` method assures that there is only one returned result;
normally a ``.query`` call returns a list of matching objects. We only
want one page, so we use ``.one()``.

Finally, we need to return a dictionary containing the ``page`` we
just looked up.  When we say::

   return dict(wikipage=page)

The returned ``dict`` will create a template variable called
``wikipage`` that will evaluate to the ``page`` object that we looked
it up.

Your ``index`` controller method should end up looking like:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 16-19

    from tg import expose, flash, require, url, request, redirect

    #More imports here...

    from wiki20.model.page import Page

    class RootController(BaseController):
        secc = SecureController()
        admin = AdminController(model, DBSession, config_type=TGAdminConfig)

        error = ErrorController()

        def _before(self, *args, **kw):
            tmpl_context.project_name = "Wiki 20"

        @expose('wiki20.templates.page')
        def index(self, pagename="FrontPage"):
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            return dict(wikipage=page)

        #more controller methods from here on...
   
Now our ``index()`` method fetches a record from the database
(creating an instance of our mapped ``Page`` class along the way), and
returns it to the template within a dictionary.

.. _adding_views:

Adding Views (Templates)
========================

.. highlight:: html

``quickstart`` also created some templates for us in the
`Wiki-20/wiki20/templates` directory: `master.xhtml` and `index.xhtml`.
Back in our simple controller, we used ``@expose()`` to hand off a
dictionary of data to a template called ``'wiki20.templates.index'``,
which corresponds to `Wiki-20/wiki20/templates/index.xhtml`.

Take a look at the following line in `index.xhtml`::

    <html py:extends="master.xhtml" py:strip="True">

This tells the ``index`` template to *extend* the ``master``
template.  Using inheritance lets you easily maintain a cohesive look and
feel throughout your site by having each page include a common master
template.

Copy the contents of `index.xhtml` into a new file called `page.xhtml`.
Now modify it for our purposes:

.. code-block:: html+genshi

    <html py:extends="master.xhtml" py:strip="True">
    <head py:block="head" py:strip="True">
        <title py:block="master_title">${wikipage.pagename} -  The TurboGears 2 Wiki</title>
    </head>

    <body py:block="body" py:strip="True">
        <div class="main_content">
            <div style="float:right; width: 10em;"> Viewing
                <span py:replace="wikipage.pagename">Page Name Goes Here</span>
                <br/>
                You can return to the <a href="/">FrontPage</a>.
            </div>

            <div py:replace="wikipage.data">Page text goes here.</div>

            <div>
                <a href="/edit/${wikipage.pagename}">Edit this page</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
   
This is a basic XHTML page with three substitutions:

1.  In the ``<title>`` tag, we substitute the name of the page, using
    the ``pagename`` value of ``page``.  (Remember, ``wikipage`` is an
    instance of our mapped ``Page`` class, which was passed in a
    dictionary by our controller.):

.. code-block:: html+genshi

    <title>${wikipage.pagename} -  The TurboGears 2 Wiki</title>

2.  In the second ``<div>`` element, we substitute the page name again
    with ``py:replace``:

.. code-block:: html+genshi

    <span py:replace="wikipage.pagename">Page Name Goes Here</span>
   
3.  In the third ``<div>``, we put in the contents of our``wikipage``:

.. code-block:: html+genshi

    <div py:replace="wikipage.data">Page text goes here.</div>

When you refresh the output web page you should see "initial data"
displayed on the page.

.. note:: :ref:`py:replace` replaces the *entire tag* (including start and
  end tags) with the value of the variable provided.

.. _editing_pages:

Editing pages
=============

One of the fundamental features of a wiki is the ability to edit the
page just by clicking "Edit This Page," so we'll create a template for
editing. First, make a copy of `page.xhtml`:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd wiki20/templates
    cp page.xhtml edit.xhtml

We need to replace the content with an editing form and ensure people
know this is an editing page. Here are the changes for ``edit.xhtml``.

#. Change the title in the header to reflect that we are editing the
   page:

    .. code-block:: html+genshi
        :emphasize-lines: 2

        <head py:block="head" py:strip="True">
          <title>Editing: ${wikipage.pagename}</title>
        </head>

#. Change the div that displays the page:

    .. code-block:: html+genshi

        <div py:replace="wikipage.data">Page text goes here.</div>

   with a div that contains a standard HTML form:

    .. code-block:: html+genshi

        <div>
          <form action="/save" method="post">
            <input type="hidden" name="pagename" value="${wikipage.pagename}"/>
            <textarea name="data" py:content="wikipage.data" rows="10" cols="60"/>
            <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Save"/>
          </form>
        </div>

.. highlight:: python

Now that we have our view, we need to update our controller in order
to display the form and handle the form submission. For displaying the
form, we'll add an ``edit`` method to our controller in
`Wiki-20/wiki20/controllers/root.py`:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 21-24

    from tg import expose, flash, require, url, request, redirect

    #More imports here...

    from wiki20.model.page import Page

    class RootController(BaseController):
        secc = SecureController()
        admin = AdminController(model, DBSession, config_type=TGAdminConfig)

        error = ErrorController()

        def _before(self, *args, **kw):
            tmpl_context.project_name = "Wiki 20"

        @expose('wiki20.templates.page')
        def index(self, pagename="FrontPage"):
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            return dict(wikipage=page)

        @expose(template="wiki20.templates.edit")
        def edit(self, pagename):
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            return dict(wikipage=page)

        #more controller methods from here on...

For now, the new method is identical to the ``index`` method; the only
difference is that the resulting dictionary is handed to the ``edit``
template. To see it work, go to
http://localhost:8080/edit/FrontPage . However, this only works because
FrontPage already exists in our database; if you try to edit a new
page with a different name it will fail, which we'll fix in a later
section.

Don't click that save button yet! We still need to write that method.

Saving Our Edits
================

When we displayed our wiki's edit form in the last section, the form's
``action`` was ``/save``.  So, we need to make a method called
``save`` in the Root class of our controller.

However, we're also going to make another important change. Our
``index`` method is *only* called when you either go to ``/`` or
``/index``. If you change the ``index`` method to the special method
``_default``, then ``_default`` will be automatically called whenever
nothing else matches. ``_default`` will take the rest of the URL and
turn it into positional parameters. This will cause the wiki to become
the default when possible.

Here's our new version of `root.py` which includes both ``_default``
and ``save``:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 16-20,27-31

    from tg import expose, flash, require, url, request, redirect

    #More imports here...

    from wiki20.model.page import Page

    class RootController(BaseController):
        secc = SecureController()
        admin = AdminController(model, DBSession, config_type=TGAdminConfig)

        error = ErrorController()

        def _before(self, *args, **kw):
            tmpl_context.project_name = "Wiki 20"

        @expose('wiki20.templates.page')
        def _default(self, pagename="FrontPage"):
            """Handle the front-page."""
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            return dict(wikipage=page)

        @expose(template="wiki20.templates.edit")
        def edit(self, pagename):
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            return dict(wikipage=page)

        @expose()
        def save(self, pagename, data, submit):
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            page.data = data
            redirect("/" + pagename)

        #more controller methods from here on...

Unlike the previous methods we've made, ``save`` just uses a plain
``@expose()`` without any template specified. That's because we're
only redirecting the user back to the viewing page.

Although the ``page.data = data`` statement tells SQLAlchemy that you
intend to store the page data in the database, you would usually
need to flush the SQLAlchemy Unit of Work and commit the currently
running transaction, those are operations that TurboGears2
transaction management will automatically do for us.

You don't have to do anything to use this transaction management
system, it should just work. So, you can now make changes and save the
page we were editing, just like a real wiki.

What About WikiWords?
=====================

Our wiki doesn't yet have a way to link pages. A typical wiki will
automatically create links for *WikiWords* when it finds them
(WikiWords have also been described as WordsSmashedTogether). This
sounds like a job for a regular expression.

Here's the new version of our ``RootController._default`` method,
which will be explained afterwards:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 20-26

    from tg import expose, flash, require, url, request, redirect

    #More imports here...

    from wiki20.model.page import Page
    import re
    from docutils.core import publish_parts

    wikiwords = re.compile(r"\b([A-Z]\w+[A-Z]+\w+)")

    class RootController(BaseController):
        secc = SecureController()
        admin = AdminController(model, DBSession, config_type=TGAdminConfig)

        error = ErrorController()

        def _before(self, *args, **kw):
            tmpl_context.project_name = "Wiki 20"

        @expose('wiki20.templates.page')
        def _default(self, pagename="FrontPage"):
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            content = publish_parts(page.data, writer_name="html")["html_body"]
            root = url('/')
            content = wikiwords.sub(r'<a href="%s\1">\1</a>' % root, content)
            return dict(content=content, wikipage=page)

        @expose(template="wiki20.templates.edit")
        def edit(self, pagename):
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            return dict(wikipage=page)

        @expose()
        def save(self, pagename, data, submit):
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
            page.data = data
            redirect("/" + pagename)

        #more controller methods from here on...

We need some additional imports, including ``re`` for regular
expressions and a method called ``publish_parts`` from ``docutils``.

A WikiWord is a word that starts with an uppercase letter, has a
collection of lowercase letters and numbers followed by another
uppercase letter and more letters and numbers. The ``wikiwords``
regular expression describes a WikiWord.

In ``_default``, the new lines begin with the use of ``publish_parts``,
which is a utility that takes string input and returns a dictionary of
document parts after performing conversions; in our case, the
conversion is from Restructured Text to HTML.  The input
(``page.data``) is in Restructured Text format, and the output format
(specified by ``writer_name="html"``) is in HTML. Selecting the
``fragment`` part produces the document without the document title,
subtitle, docinfo, header, and footer.

You can configure TurboGears so that it doesn't live at the root of a
site, so you can combine multiple TurboGears apps on a single
server. Using ``tg.url()`` creates relative links, so that your links
will continue to work regardless of how many apps you're running.

The next line rewrites the ``content`` by finding any WikiWords and
substituting hyperlinks for those WikiWords. That way when you click
on a WikiWord, it will take you to that page. The ``r'string'`` means
'raw string', one that turns off escaping, which is mostly used in
regular expression strings to prevent you from having to double escape
slashes. The substitution may look a bit weird, but is more
understandable if you recognize that the ``%s`` gets substituted with
``root``, then the substitution is done which replaces the ``\1`` with
the string matching the regex.

Note that ``_default()`` is now returning a ``dict`` containing an
additional key-value pair: ``content=content``. This will not break
``wiki20.templates.page`` because that page is only looking for
``page`` in the dictionary, however if we want to do something
interesting with the new key-value pair we'll need to edit
``wiki20.templates.page``:

.. code-block:: html+genshi
    :emphasize-lines: 14

    <html py:extends="master.xhtml" py:strip="True">
    <head py:block="head" py:strip="True">
        <title py:block="master_title">${wikipage.pagename} -  The TurboGears 2 Wiki</title>
    </head>

    <body py:block="body" py:strip="True">
        <div class="main_content">
            <div style="float:right; width: 10em;"> Viewing
                <span py:replace="wikipage.pagename">Page Name Goes Here</span>
                <br/>
                You can return to the <a href="/">FrontPage</a>.
            </div>

            <div py:replace="Markup(content)">Formatted content goes here.</div>

            <div>
                <a href="/edit/${wikipage.pagename}">Edit this page</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>

Since ``content`` comes through as XML, we can strip it off using the
``Markup()`` function to produce plain text (try removing the function
call to see what happens).

To test the new version of the system, edit the data in your front
page to include a WikiWord. When the page is displayed, you'll see
that it's now a link.  You probably won't be surprised to find that
clicking that link produces an error.


Hey, Where's The Page?
======================

What if a Wiki page doesn't exist? We'll take a simple approach: if
the page doesn't exist, you get an edit page to use to create it.

In the ``_default`` method, we'll check to see if the page exists.

If it doesn't, we'll redirect to a new ``notfound`` method. We'll add
this method after the ``_default`` method and before the ``edit``
method.

Here are the new ``notfound`` and the updated ``_default``
methods for our ``RootController`` class:

.. code-block:: python

    @expose('wiki20.templates.page')
    def _default(self, pagename="FrontPage"):
        from sqlalchemy.exc import InvalidRequestError

        try:
            page = DBSession.query(Page).filter_by(pagename=pagename).one()
        except InvalidRequestError:
            raise redirect("notfound", params={"pagename": pagename})

        content = publish_parts(page.data, writer_name="html")["html_body"]
        root = url('/')
        content = wikiwords.sub(r'<a href="%s\1">\1</a>' % root, content)
        return dict(content=content, wikipage=page)

    @expose("wiki20.templates.edit")
    def notfound(self, pagename):
        page = Page(pagename=pagename, data="")
        DBSession.add(page)
        return dict(wikipage=page)

In the ``_default`` code we now first try to get the page and
then deal with the exception by redirecting to a method that
will make a new page.

As for the ``notfound`` method, the first two lines of the method add
a row to the page table. From there, the path is exactly the same it
would be for our ``edit`` method.

With these changes in place, we have a fully functional wiki. Give it
a try!  You should be able to create new pages now.

Adding A Page List
==================

Most wikis have a feature that lets you view an index of the pages. To
add one, we'll start with a new template, `pagelist.xhtml`. We'll copy
`page.xhtml` so that we don't have to write the boilerplate.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd wiki20/templates
    cp page.xhtml pagelist.xhtml

After editing, our `pagelist.xhtml` looks like:

.. code-block:: html+genshi
    :emphasize-lines: 10-15

    <html py:extends="master.xhtml" py:strip="True">
    <head py:block="head" py:strip="True">
        <title py:block="master_title">Page Listing -  The TurboGears 2 Wiki</title>
    </head>

    <body py:block="body" py:strip="True">
        <div class="main_content">
            <h1>All Pages</h1>
            <ul>
                <li py:for="pagename in pages">
                    <a href="${tg.url('/' + pagename)}"
                       py:content="pagename">
                         Page Name Here.
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Return to the <a href="/">FrontPage</a>.
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>

The highlighted section represents the template code of interest. You can
guess that the ``py:for`` is a python ``for`` loop, modified to fit
into Kajiki's XML. It iterates through each of the ``pages`` (which
we'll send in via the controller, using a modification you'll see
next). For each one, ``Page Name Here`` is replaced by ``pagename``,
as is the URL. You can learn more about the :ref:`kajiki-language`.


We must also modify the ``RootController`` class to implement ``pagelist`` and to
create and pass ``pages`` to our template:

.. code-block:: python

    @expose("wiki20.templates.pagelist")
    def pagelist(self):
        pages = [page.pagename for page in DBSession.query(Page).order_by(Page.pagename)]
        return dict(pages=pages)

Here, we select all of the ``Page`` objects from the database, and
order them by pagename.

We can also modify `page.xhtml` so that the link to the page list is
available on every page:

.. code-block:: html+genshi
    :emphasize-lines: 14

    <html py:extends="master.xhtml" py:strip="True">
    <head py:block="head" py:strip="True">
        <title py:block="master_title">${wikipage.pagename} -  The TurboGears 2 Wiki</title>
    </head>

    <body py:block="body" py:strip="True">
        <div class="main_content">
            <div style="float:right; width: 10em;"> Viewing
                <span py:replace="wikipage.pagename">Page Name Goes Here</span>
                <br/>
                You can return to the <a href="/">FrontPage</a>.
            </div>

            <div py:replace="Markup(content)">Formatted content goes here.</div>

            <div>
                <a href="/edit/${wikipage.pagename}">Edit this page</a>
                <a href="/pagelist">View the page list</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>

You can see your pagelist by clicking the link on a page or by going
directly to http://localhost:8080/pagelist .
